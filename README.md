# Library Project Overview

Discover this Library Project, which offers seamless book addition and deletion, along with options for book covers, authors, user ratings, and statuses. Utilizing prototypal inheritance for efficient code and responsive design with grid and flexbox layouts, the project ensures dynamic usability. Enhancements include managing HTML collections and nodes, a system for custom book covers, and a star rating system. Future updates aim to improve screen reader support.

## Key Features

- Book Management: Allows adding book titles with optional details such as book cover, author, pages, reader's rating, and current reading status.
- Delete Functionality: Supports deleting individual books and resetting the library entirely.
- Visual Ratings: Incorporates a star rating system for visual feedback.
- Responsive Design: Utilizes both grid and flexbox layouts for horizontal responsiveness.
- Dynamic Font Adjustment: Adjusts font size for long book titles.
- Duplicate Check: Alerts users if a book title and author already exist in the library.
- Prototypal Inheritance: Implemented in constructors, methods, and functions.

## Constraints

- No Editing Feature: Books cannot be edited after addition, only their status can be modified.
- Accessibility Considerations: Some features, like the star rating system, do not yet support screen readers.

## Additional Concepts Explored

- JavaScript Techniques: Prototypal inheritance, arrow functions for context preservation, and DOM manipulation.
- HTML Collections and Nodes: Understanding the differences between nodes and HTML collections, and applying various types of loops (such as for...of and forEach) for effective iteration and manipulation.
- Button Best Practices: Encapsulation of clickable elements within <button> tags.
- File Encapsulation: Studied methods to encapsulate files for creating a system to manage book covers, including provisions for default covers when users do not upload their own.

## Applications Used

- Visual Studio Code
- Figma for design elements
- Git and GitHub for version control
- CodePen.io for testing and development
- Third-party code integrated for additional functionalities
